          Recently, I had the exhilarating opportunity to perform live coding at
          the vibrant Caffeine Underground in Bushwick. I initially was provided
          20 minutes, however, due to prior technical issues with my peers'
          performance, I was given a 10-minute window instead.

          Live coding, often dubbed as on-the-fly programming, transcends
          conventional musical genres, serving as a conduit for crafting
          soundscapes and visual tapestries in the digital domain. The chosen
          medium for this event was Sonic Pi. Drawing inspiration from my
          deep-rooted fascination with South Asian music, my performance
          resonated with an Indo-Western fusion, an eclectic blend of cultural
          influences woven into a harmonious tapestry of sound.

          With this performance, the tempo was set to 100 beats per minute, and
          four melodies were defined, each consisting of a sequence of MIDI note
          values. Additionally, two variables were defined to specify the
          duration of the notes. Within the first live loop, an echo effect was
          applied to the melody. The loop iterated four times, selecting a
          melody each time. Within each iteration, the loop iterated ten times
          to play notes from the selected melody using a plucked synth. The
          duration of each note was determined by the corresponding duration
          pattern. The second part of the code involves another live loop, which
          features a single melody defined with a sequence of MIDI note values
          and corresponding durations. A reverb effect was applied, and the loop
          iterated eight times. During each iteration, a note from the melody
          was played using a plucked synth, and a bass drum sound (bd_ada) was
          also included. The third and final loop consists of a series of note
          values that create a soft melody layered over the other two loops.

          The overall experience of this performance was phenomenal. Despite
          being in a new environment with a different audience, I felt a sense
          of pride in myself. In my initial experience, I harbored several
          regrets, feeling as though I couldn't fully realize my intentions due
          to mistakes. However, in this performance, I maintained my composure
          even when errors occurred and time constraints loomed. Ultimately, I
          succeeded in sharing the type of music that captivates me. Consistency
          in working with the same equipment proved essential, fostering a
          deeper sense of familiarity within an otherwise unfamiliar setting.
          Additionally, I derived great enjoyment from both listening to others'
          performances and crafting music through codeâ€”an art form that serves
          as a unique expression of self. In the crucible of live coding, where
          the boundaries between creator and creation blur into oblivion, I
          discovered the transformative power of music as a vessel for
          self-expression.
